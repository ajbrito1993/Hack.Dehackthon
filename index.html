  <h1 class="learnJavaHeader"> Learn JavaScript as a Second Language!!! </h1>

  <p class="pageDescription"> Reading and writing in English are expected as standard skills of a high school graduate
    in the United States, not necessarily because we expect everyone to become a professional writer, but rather so that
    they can communicate and express themselves at a high level. In world that is increasingly tech literate and powered
    by code, what happens if we start to think coding not as a skill limited to computer programmers, but for anyone
    looking to express their own ideas, digitally? Our lives and world run by algorithmic code, so far written by a
    mostly homogenous group of people. What does it look like if we can introduce coding earlier, with high schoolers as
    fluent in JavaScript as they are in Algebra? Which one would they end up using more later in life? What
    interdisciplinary or critical thinking skills are engaged?
